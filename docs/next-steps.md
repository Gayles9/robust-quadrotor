# Next-step plan

The bounded startup/hover study is closed. Its single coherent-force candidate
reduced spline effort and passed the paired spline comparison, but failed the
unchanged full-hover requirement. I retained the cascade default and original
geometric implementation. The [verification record](progress/2026-09-26-geometric-transient-closeout.md)
explains the diagnosis and rejection. Estimated-feedback qualification remains
open; closing a tuning study does not close that flight gate.

## Completed: observation health monitoring

The [monitor](observation-health.md) reports accepted-observation age, recent
dispositions and explicit loss/recovery transitions separately for position and
altitude. Its optional mission integration is passive. Complete mission and
saved-payload equality, causal reconstruction, timing boundaries, recovery and
invalid-input behavior are covered by the
[verification record](progress/2026-09-28-observation-health-monitoring.md).

## Completed: bounded observation loss supervision

The [supervisor](observation-supervision.md) applies explicit, independent
unhealthy-time budgets and a latched numerical abort. Local position is required
in all active phases; altitude can be explicitly optional. Recovery must finish
before expiry, phase changes preserve the timers, existing safety guards retain
priority, and terminal epochs issue no command. The
[verification record](progress/2026-09-28-observation-loss-supervision.md)
documents component fault injection, closed-loop regression and saved-evidence
reconstruction. This closes the bounded response-interface step, not general
robust-flight qualification or a hardware fallback policy.

## Completed: integrated robustness evaluation

The [frozen campaign](integrated-robustness.md) executes twelve paired cases
with original cascade parameters and known seeds. It retains actual hover,
translation and virtual landing, causal position/altitude faults, recovery,
wind and mass mismatch. Each mode's full saved evidence is authenticated and
reconstructed before response and flight criteria are scored separately.
The [verification record](progress/2026-09-28-integrated-robustness.md) preserves
all outcomes, including the failed hover peak and mass-mismatch landing.

## Completed: bounded vertical disturbance compensation

The [single-candidate study](vertical-compensation.md) diagnoses the mass offset
against the PD equilibrium and evaluates one bounded vertical integral with
health gating, conditional anti-windup and exact trace reconstruction. The
[verification record](progress/2026-09-28-vertical-compensation.md) preserves
all twelve paired comparisons against the original authenticated baseline.

The candidate fixes the tested mass-case landing timeout and greatly reduces
its final error, but whole-flight RMSE is 17.57 cm against the original 15 cm
limit. It also fails the frozen hover no-regression condition, even though the
increase is small. The original 8 cm hover requirement remains open. Keep the
original cascade default and retain the candidate only as an explicit research
option. Do not retune it, loosen the comparison or promote a mass-offset benefit
into whole-flight qualification. Geometric qualification remains separate.

## Completed: technical report and operating boundary

The [report consolidation](technical-report.md) updates the original LaTeX
report to the current mathematical stack and evidence. It separates implemented
software, development results, unresolved flight qualification and unimplemented
integration. Source/report identities, reproduction instructions, failed studies,
controller defaults and numerical-abort limitations are explicit. The
[verification record](progress/2026-09-28-technical-report.md) records the audit.
No controller, threshold, seed or mission behavior changed.

## Next bounded task: causal early-flight diagnosis

Audit the report closeout and reauthenticate the original mass/hover histories.
Reproduce their full-flight metrics before analyzing the startup interval.
The mass candidate's first-five-second RMSE is 29.736 cm versus 3.286 cm over
its last five seconds; this motivates a transient investigation, not a new
scoring window. Hover causality must be established separately.

1. Decompose saved tracking error by axis, phase and declared diagnostic windows.
   Distinguish reference-to-truth error from estimate-to-truth error.
2. Reconstruct commanded and achieved force, attitude, motor lag, limits,
   observation health and integral-learning timing. State a testable mechanism
   with predicted signs, timing and magnitude.
3. If needed, use an independently checked local model or a single-factor
   counterfactual to distinguish causes. Mark altered initialization or oracle
   inputs as diagnostic, not qualification.
4. Return a causal finding with its uncertainty and an explicit go/no-go.
   Only then scope one justified candidate with unchanged regression and
   full-flight acceptance.

Acceptance is reproducible attribution and a bounded next experiment or a
justified stop, not a promised controller pass. Do not sweep gains/cutoffs,
open reserved seeds, discard startup, move the scoring clock, or relax limits.
This task does not automatically reopen the closed geometric study or authorize
implementation of a controller candidate.

Any future project-completion percentage must declare an agreed weighted
milestone denominator; campaign pass fractions are not project completion.

## Later milestones

- Implement custom ROS 2/PX4 integration under separate acceptance criteria.

The reserved geometric qualification seeds remain unopened. Reopening controller
design needs a new, evidence-based scope; another gain or cutoff search is not
the automatic next action.
