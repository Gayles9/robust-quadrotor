# Next-step plan

The bounded startup/hover study is closed. Its single coherent-force candidate
reduced spline effort and passed the paired spline comparison, but failed the
unchanged full-hover requirement. I retained the cascade default and original
geometric implementation. The [verification record](progress/2026-09-26-geometric-transient-closeout.md)
explains the diagnosis and rejection. Estimated-feedback qualification remains
open; closing a tuning study does not close that flight gate.

## Completed: observation health monitoring

The [monitor](observation-health.md) reports accepted-observation age, recent
dispositions and explicit loss/recovery transitions separately for position and
altitude. Its optional mission integration is passive. Complete mission and
saved-payload equality, causal reconstruction, timing boundaries, recovery and
invalid-input behavior are covered by the
[verification record](progress/2026-09-28-observation-health-monitoring.md).

## Completed: bounded observation loss supervision

The [supervisor](observation-supervision.md) applies explicit, independent
unhealthy-time budgets and a latched numerical abort. Local position is required
in all active phases; altitude can be explicitly optional. Recovery must finish
before expiry, phase changes preserve the timers, existing safety guards retain
priority, and terminal epochs issue no command. The
[verification record](progress/2026-09-28-observation-loss-supervision.md)
documents component fault injection, closed-loop regression and saved-evidence
reconstruction. This closes the bounded response-interface step, not general
robust-flight qualification or a hardware fallback policy.

## Completed: integrated robustness evaluation

The [frozen campaign](integrated-robustness.md) executes twelve paired cases
with original cascade parameters and known seeds. It retains actual hover,
translation and virtual landing, causal position/altitude faults, recovery,
wind and mass mismatch. Each mode's full saved evidence is authenticated and
reconstructed before response and flight criteria are scored separately.
The [verification record](progress/2026-09-28-integrated-robustness.md) preserves
all outcomes, including the failed hover peak and mass-mismatch landing.

## Completed: bounded vertical disturbance compensation

The [single-candidate study](vertical-compensation.md) diagnoses the mass offset
against the PD equilibrium and evaluates one bounded vertical integral with
health gating, conditional anti-windup and exact trace reconstruction. The
[verification record](progress/2026-09-28-vertical-compensation.md) preserves
all twelve paired comparisons against the original authenticated baseline.

The candidate fixes the tested mass-case landing timeout and greatly reduces
its final error, but whole-flight RMSE is 17.57 cm against the original 15 cm
limit. It also fails the frozen hover no-regression condition, even though the
increase is small. The original 8 cm hover requirement remains open. Keep the
original cascade default and retain the candidate only as an explicit research
option. Do not retune it, loosen the comparison or promote a mass-offset benefit
into whole-flight qualification. Geometric qualification remains separate.

## Next bounded task: technical report and operating boundary

Audit this closeout against the merged source, software checks and saved
evidence. Consolidate the current mathematical architecture and verified results
into the technical report: plant, sensor timing, ESKF assumptions, planning,
controller tradeoffs, observation health, timed response and disturbance study.

Include a traceable capability table separating implemented software, bounded
development evidence, unresolved qualification and unimplemented integration.
Preserve the original limits, every failed controller study and the distinction
between numerical abort and a physical emergency maneuver. Cite exact source
commits and evidence hashes; do not present development seeds as new validation.
Any progress estimate must declare its milestone denominator and weighting.

Acceptance requires reconciled numbers and source references, reproducible
commands and evidence locations, a clear default-controller decision, and an
explicit list of open flight requirements. Identify the later ROS 2/PX4
integration interface and its required acceptance criteria without implementing
middleware or claiming hardware readiness. This is consolidation of verified
work, not another gain search or an automatic controller promotion.

## Later milestones

- Implement custom ROS 2/PX4 integration under separate acceptance criteria.

The reserved geometric qualification seeds remain unopened. Reopening controller
design needs a new, evidence-based scope; another gain or cutoff search is not
the automatic next action.
